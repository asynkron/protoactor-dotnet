/// <summary>
///     Optimized version of the Rendezvous algorithm.
///     Instead of calculating Hash each time for Key+Node combination,
///     it simply precalculates Node hash, then calculates Key hash and
///     does a basic hash combination to determine a combined hash. Uses
///     combined hash to determine the owner.
///     Identity distribution over nodes is just as good as Rendezvous,
///     while being 50x faster at 1000 nodes, 25x faster at 100 nodes, and 6x faster at 10 nodes.
///     Also, it does minimal allocations in comparison to Rendezvous, identical to MemberRing.
///     WARNING: Any modifications in this class could cause old version cluster
///     members to be incompatible with the new version cluster members, and it
///     would result in duplicate parallel activations.
